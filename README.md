## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

For responsiveness I used rems for text so that I only have to change the
```
html {
  font-size:
}
```
This was a fast way to make sure that everything kept the right size while making everything larger.

This has been an interesting challenge. I thought it was going to be way easier that it ended up being. Having images as "position: absolute" makes it really hard to make sure that they don't get lost if screen sizes get extreme.
Also I'm having trouble with the image that does not have "overflow: hidden" on the main container since most of the images have it.


### Continued development

I really want to keep practicing and understanding a little bit better rems and Mobile-first. I'm having a problem with the smallest view on desktop because it is taking the styles of the mibile version but it is to small for desktops.


### Useful resources

Also I've been having a ton of fun in codewars but working with the dom is different and realized that I'm not comfortable enough with that.
- [Example resource 1](https://courses.webdevsimplified.com/) - I bought the javascript course since I was able to see that I'm still a little bit behind. This tutorial helped me understand a lot of things that I was missing.
